title: "Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript"
---

This course teaches you how to implement your first data structures and algorithms. In the process, you’ll learn some fundamental computer science concepts as well. We’ll build these from scratch using JavaScript, but what we learn can be taken and used in any other language, too. You will learn how to build: queues, stacks, linked lists, graphs, and trees. You’ll learn to implement several different sorting algorithms: bubble, insert, merge, and quick. Each of these lessons will not only teach you their implementation, but the tradeoffs made in choosing one over another. By proxy, you’ll learn about concepts like Big O notation and recursion.

Cascading style sheet (CSS) selectors are the glue that connects styling to HTML content. Understanding how they work enables a developer to write more semantic markup and keeps styling modular for better project maintenance. In this course, we will start with basic selectors and work our way through more complex classification of selectors, explaining common use cases along the way. Finally, we’ll look at how selectors can be combined and how selector specificity can create some common problems.
